# my-first-repo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is my first repository.

It contains several folders with assets.

- Folder `images` contains jpeg, bmp, and so on files that I need for my
  documents.
- Folder `plots` contains images that I generate through code, possibly
  for publisher.

The function `print()` will display the argument on the screen.

``` r
print("Hello, World")
#> [1] "Hello, World"
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output
will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press
*Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the
editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code
chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the
editor is displayed.
